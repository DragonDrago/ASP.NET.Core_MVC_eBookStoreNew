eBookSaleProject_complete_ASP.NET.CORE_MVC. The webApp can be improved by deploying, but it is not free, so I stopped the project in that step.But, if you want (employer) I can deploy it to web, next to you.(to AWS or Azure, it does not matter). However, It is possible to create Db in AWS=>RDS and deploy the app to azure or vica versa Db in Azure and Deploying the app in AWS. But it is recomended to use the same service to WebApp and DB.
